Yes, your implementation seems reasonable. When the processClient function receives 
data from the socket and forks a child process, the child process will close the 
original socket descriptor using close(setup.socketNum) and then proceed to execute the 
processState function. This pattern is commonly used in network server programs where each client connection is handled by a separate child process.

However, make sure to handle errors properly, especially the 
case when fork() fails (pid < 0). In your code, you're printing an error 
message, but you may want to consider whether to exit the child process or 
continue the loop in the parent process, depending on your application logic.
